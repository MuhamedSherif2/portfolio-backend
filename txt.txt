💡 My Recommendation:
For a freelancer portfolio:

Stick to your 10 main sections

Add Case Studies / Blog / Certifications if you want to impress clients further

Avoid clutter — keep the portfolio clean and easy to navigate

If you want, I can create a final full portfolio structure including:

Main sections + optional add-ons

Component layout for React + Tailwind

Dark & Light mode ready

Do you want me to make that full plan?
